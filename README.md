## Lane Detection with FCN and UNet on the TuSimple Dataset
![Description](Lane-detection/laneinferenceimage.png)
This project involves training and evaluating two neural network models for lane detection on the TuSimple dataset. The models used are:

1. **FCN with ResNet50 Backbone**
   - **Performance**: Achieved 97.79% accuracy on the test subset.

2. **UNet with MobileNetV2 Encoder**
   - **Performance**: Achieved 95.75% accuracy on the test subset.

The weights for these trained models are provided in this repository. 

### Models

- **FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) with ResNet50 Backbone**
- **UNet with MobileNetV2 Encoder**

### Dataset

- **TuSimple**: A benchmark dataset used for lane detection.

### Results

- **FCN (ResNet50 Backbone)**: 97.79% accuracy on the test subset.
- **UNet (MobileNetV2 Encoder)**: 95.75% accuracy on the test subset.
